# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

Understanding the traits of each group and engaging them with relevant campaigns is more effective than segmentation based on customer age or geography.

Recent purchases: customers who make recent purchases are more likely to respond to promotions.
Frequency of purchases: customers who frequently buy products are more engaged and satisfied.
Monetary value: the monetary value of purchases can differentiate between heavy spenders and low-value purchasers.
